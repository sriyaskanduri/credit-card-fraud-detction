🏦 Credit Card Fraud Detection
📌 Overview
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using Random Forests and Decision Trees. A key challenge is class imbalance, as fraud cases make up only 0.17% of the dataset. The project applies techniques to address this issue and improve model performance.

✨ Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand fraud patterns
Comparison of Decision Trees vs. Random Forests
Handling Class Imbalance to improve fraud detection
Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)


📊 Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions.
It has a severe class imbalance:
Fraudulent Transactions: 0.17%
Genuine Transactions: 99.83%

🔍 Key Insights
Random Forest outperforms Decision Trees for fraud detection.
Class Imbalance Handling is crucial; otherwise, the model predicts most transactions as genuine.
Feature Engineering & Resampling techniques improve fraud classification.

📝 Usage
Load the dataset and explore transaction patterns.
Train and evaluate Random Forests & Decision Trees.
Apply techniques to handle class imbalance for better fraud detection.
